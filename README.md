# Network Design with Integer Frank Wolfe
Repository for Project on Network Design using the Integer Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

To run the experiments use the various scripts from the examples folder. 
The parameter settings and the data set for which the experiment needs to be run are specified in these script files. 

The first time that the script is run it will download the Transportation Networks dataset from the repository https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks.
This data set contains the network data on which the network design problem is run.
